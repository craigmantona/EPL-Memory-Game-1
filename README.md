## UX


## User goals

## Website owner business goals

Create a basic memory game that is fun and easy to play.


## User stories

### As a site owner

* I want visitors to my game to be able to use my website intuitively and easily.
* I would like visitors to my game be able to easily find the rules on how to play the game.
* I would like visitors to my game be able to ask me any questions via a contact form.

### As a visitor to the site

* As a fan of the Premier League I would like to know the current league standings.
* I would like to know what the top score is.
* I would like to know how I performed in my game. Time and moves.

## Structure of the website

I have tried to make a website that is easy to access, and that has similar visuals/colour themes throughout. 
It should be fully accessible on a range of devices and simple to navigate for all.
I have asked some friends and family for their input and to test interaction

## Wireframes

I used the site https://www.edrawmax.com/ to create the wireframes for the site.

## Surface

### Colors
Main colours used in a project:
* background was an image
* other background colors used: whitesmoke, #007 (a bold blue) and antiquewhite


### Fonts 

* The Noto Sans TC font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sana-Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Noto Sans TC is a clean and clear font, so it is both attractive and appropriate. 

### Images

* All images are credited in [credits](#credits) section.

## Issues found during site development

* The API site that I signed up to use on the site proved to be unreliable and I had to abandon it in favour of the google map api.

* The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.

* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone8, iPad Pro & iPhone11.

* Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

* Issue with getting the cards to flip caused a lot of headaches. I got a friend (Palmjit Kunnar) to cast his eyes over my js code and he found my problem. I had accidentaly left some code out of the curly brackets that meant the js always stopped after the first click.


## Performance testing

I ran [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.
Screenshots are presented below:

<img src="/assets/images/lighthouse.png" alt="Images of performance from Lighthouse."/>


### Known bugs
The bottom of the cards on the game screen are slightly off the bottom of the screen.
