# Craig's EPL Memory Game

## Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project.

EPL Memory Game - my second milestone project - a site for educational purpose based on the clubs in the English Premier League.
<!-- ## [Link to finished GYM site](https://craigmantona.github.io/GYM-project/) -->

This is my GYM website that I have made by using the skills and code from the course so far (Love running, CV, Whiskey Drop to mention a few.)

This website has been made with an established gym in mind. I have tried to make a website that is easy to access, and that has similar visuals/colour themes throughout. It should be fully accessible on a range of devices and simple to navigate for new GYM users and regular members.
I have visited several gym sites in my life and I have tried to encourporate all of the information that I considered to be vital. I have asked some friends and family for their input, and have added some extra features as a result of that interaction.

I have tried to make a website that is easy to access, and that has similar visuals/colour themes throughout. 
It should be fully accessible on a range of devices and simple to navigate for new GYM users and regular members.

## Surface

### Colors
<!-- Main colours used in a project:

## Issues found during site development

<!-- * Original font used - Bebas Neue - was replaced as the all caps view seemed a bit aggresive throughout the site.

* The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.

* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone8, iPad Pro & iPhone11.

* Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

* I got my wife, brother and a friend to test the site as a 'new visitor'. Some styling ideas were put forward resulting in some font colour changes and a different look to the gym classes descriptions view.
My mentor also looked through it when I was part way through and advised me to change the font and also to compress the images so the site would load quicker.

* Linking issue within the navbar corrected after testing. Home gage icon was not set to link to Home page and was therefore linking to an error 404 page instead.

* Images were only showing up on local site and not the website. Changed the linking to the images to rectify issue. -->


## Performance testing

<!-- I ran [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.
Screenshots are presented below:

<img src="/assets/images/lighthouse.png" alt="Images of performance from Lighthouse."/>


### Known bugs
On some mobile devices the videos of the Personal Trainers are seen as still images. -->
